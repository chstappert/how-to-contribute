# How to contribute to Open Source 
This will start a mini guide or manifest of "How to contribute to open source". I will cover the following topics: 

## Content

- How to start
- Does and Don'ts 
- How to get help 
- First steps 
- How to use Ai (Example and idea from: [Using Ai in open source](https://roe.dev/blog/using-ai-in-open-source))

## Pages

Pages, you can link to your repo to commit to a specific rule set, like using Ai, using Docs etc. 

It will be available here: [how-to-contribute.dev](https://how-to-contribute.dev)

# Next steps

We will install Nuxt (Docs) and start ;-). Would be nice to discuss some things before: [Issues](https://github.com/chstappert/how-to-contribute/issues)
